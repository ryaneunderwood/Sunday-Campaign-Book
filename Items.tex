\section{Fruits of Forgetting}
Fruits of Forgetting are one of Merope's four sacred fruits. They are small, red, banana-shaped fruits with a pleasant aroma. If a creature eats them, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12+number of bites) or it will become disorientated, oblivious, forgetful, and passive. The creature will not aid any allies or attack any creature that has not attacked it, nor will it take any actions to flee. The effects will take place one minute after eating fruits of forgetting, and last for a number of hours equal to the number of bites consumed. A single fruit has five bites if entirely consumed. Seafolk are immune to the effects of Fruits of Forgetting, and consume it for a light buzz.
